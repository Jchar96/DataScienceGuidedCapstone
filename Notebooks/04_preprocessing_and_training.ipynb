    "In preceding notebooks, performed preliminary assessments of data quality and refined the question to be answered. You found a small number of data values that gave clear choices about whether to replace values or drop a whole row. You determined that predicting the adult weekend ticket price was your primary aim. You threw away records with missing price data, but not before making the most of the other available data to look for any patterns between the states. You didn't see any and decided to treat all states equally; the state label didn't seem to be particularly useful.\n",

    "In this notebook you'll start to build machine learning models. Before even starting with learning a machine learning model, however, start by considering how useful the mean value is as a predictor. This is more than just a pedagogical device. You never want to go to stakeholders with a machine learning model only to have the CEO point out that it performs worse than just guessing the average! Your first model is a baseline performance comparitor for any subsequent model. You then build up the process of efficiently and robustly creating and assessing models against it. The development we lay out may be little slower than in the real world, but this step of the capstone is definitely more than just instructional. It is good practice to build up an understanding that the machine learning pipelines you build work as expected. You can validate steps with your own functions for checking expected equivalence between, say, pandas and sklearn implementations."

    "So far, you've treated ski resort data as a single entity. In machine learning, when you train your model on all of your data, you end up with no data set aside to evaluate model performance. You could keep making more and more complex models that fit the data better and better and not realise you were overfitting to that one set of samples. By partitioning the data into training and testing splits, without letting a model (or missing-value imputation) learn anything about the test split, you have a somewhat independent assessment of how your model might perform in the future. An often overlooked subtlety here is that people all too frequently use the test set to assess model performance _and then compare multiple models to pick the best_. This means their overall model selection process is  fitting to one specific data set, now the test split. You could keep going, trying to get better and better performance on that one data set, but that's  where cross-validation becomes especially useful. While training models, a test split is very useful as a final check on expected future performance."

    "You could keep going, trying different values of k, training a model, measuring performance on the test set, and then picking the model with the best test set performance. There's a fundamental problem with this approach: _you're tuning the model to the arbitrary test set_! If you continue this way you'll end up with a model works well on the particular quirks of our test set _but fails to generalize to new data_. The whole point of keeping a test set is for it to be a set of that new data, to check how well our model might perform on data it hasn't seen.\n",

You partition the training set into k folds, train our model on k-1 of those folds, and calculate performance on the fold not used in training. This procedure then cycles through k times with a different fold held back each time. Thus you end up building k models on k sets of data with k estimates of how the model performs on unseen data but without having to touch the test set."

    "These results suggest that vertical drop is your biggest positive feature. This makes intuitive sense and is consistent with what you saw during the EDA work. Also, you see the area covered by snow making equipment is a strong positive as well. People like guaranteed skiing! The skiable terrain area is negatively associated with ticket price! This seems odd. People will pay less for larger resorts? There could be all manner of reasons for this. It could be  an effect whereby larger resorts can host more visitors at any one time and so can charge less per ticket. As has been mentioned previously, the data are missing information about visitor numbers. Bear in mind,  the coefficient for skiable terrain is negative _for this model_. For example, if you kept the total number of chairs and fastQuads constant, but increased the skiable terrain extent, you might imagine the resort is worse off because the chairlift capacity is stretched thinner."

    "**Q: 1** Write a summary of the work in this notebook. Capture the fact that you gained a baseline idea of performance by simply taking the average price and how well that did. Then highlight that you built a linear model and the features that found. Comment on the estimate of its performance from cross-validation and whether its performance on the test split was consistent with this estimate. Also highlight that a random forest regressor was tried, what preprocessing steps were found to be best, and again what its estimated performance via cross-validation was and whether its performance on the test set was consistent with that. State which model you have decided to use going forwards and why. This summary should provide a quick overview for someone wanting to know quickly why the given model was chosen for the next part of the business problem to help guide important business decisions."

    "**A: 1** In this notebook I set about training a predictive machine learning model to determine the weekend ticket prices for ski resorts. To do this I relied on the pandas, numpy, and sklearn python packages. My ski data was then partitioned into a training and testing split in order to evaluated and cross-validate my ML model. All non-numeric data was dropped from the testing and training datasets. I started by assessing the mean values as a predictor. Using sklearn's DummyRegressor on the training dataset I was able to predict the mean down to the e-8 decimal point. I wanted to further assess how good our predicted set of values agrees with the actual data using metrics, specifically the coefficient of determination. A model that perfectly predicts the observed values would have no residual error and so give R2 = 1. Models that do worse than predicting the mean will have increased the sum of squares of residuals and so produce a negative R2. I then defined a function to return the R2 and made my predictions by creating an array of the length and size of the training set with the single value of the mean. Again the DummyRegressor produces exactly the same results. As expected, when passed the average value as a prediction we get an R2 value of 0 on our training set. I then made my predictions by creating an array of length the size of the test set with the single value of the (training) mean. This returned an expected negative value as its expected for performance of the testing set to be slightly worse than the training set. I then set out to determine the difference between predicted and actual values with mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE). I defined functions to return both values. When my test set was passed to the MEA function, I determined that I could expect to be ~19$ off if the ticket price was predicted using the average of known values. These observations were further confirmed when the test and training data was passed through the MSE function. Next, I set about imputing missing feature values using the scikit-learn package. The median values were imputed from the train set. Then the imputations were applies to both train and test splits and the data was scaled using the StandardScaler python package. I then trained the model on the training split and made prediction using the model on both train and test splits. The model was then assessed with R2, MAE and MSE. I made the observation that my simple linear regression model explains over 80% of the variance on the train set and over 70% on the test set. The much lower value for the test set suggests you're overfitting somewhat; this is to be expected as I have made no effort to select a parsimonious set of features or deal with multicollinearity in our data at this point. I then set to impute the missing values with the mean rather than the median. The results did not greatly differ from one another. I then used sklearn's pipeline component to perform the following steps trained on the train split and then applied to the test split for assessment: \n",
    "\n",
    "\t1. Replace missing values with the median for each feature \n",
    "\t2. Scale the data to zero mean and unit variance\n",
    "\t3. Train a linear regression model \n",
    "\n",
    "I then fit the pipeline to the train and test sets, made predictions on the sets, and assessed its performance. The results were identical to the ones gained in earlier examination. I then set about refining the linear model by defining a new pipeline to select a different number of features. After this, I assessed the performance of the pipeline using cross-validation. I then had a pipeline with the following features: \n",
    "\n",
    "\t• Imputes missing values \n",
    "\t• Scales the data \n",
    "\t• Selects the k best features \n",
    "\t• Trains a linear regression model \n",
    "\n",
    "I also now have a cross-evaluation technique for estimating model performance. I then used cross-validation for multiple values of k and used the GridSearchCV feature of sklearn to pick the value of k that gives the best performance. I observed that a good value for k is 8. the analysis showed an initial rapid increase with k, followed by a slow decline. Also noticeable is the variance of the results greatly increase above k=8. As you increasingly overfit, expect greater swings in performance as different points move in and out of the train/test folds. Now that a k best value was determined, I determined features that were the most useful by using my best model. My results suggested that vertical drop is the biggest positive feature. This is consistent with what you saw during my EDA.  The amount of Snowmaking acreage is a strong positive as well. The skiable terrain area is negatively associated with ticket price. This could be an effect whereby larger resorts can host more visitors at any one time and so can charge less per ticket. As has been mentioned previously, the data is missing information about visitor numbers per year. To further evaluate, I created a random forest model. Using this model I was able to marginally improve upon the default CV results and was able to identify the dominate top four features: \n",
    "\n",
    "\t• fastQuads \n",
    "\t• Runs \n",
    "\t• Snow Making_ac\n",
    "\t• Vertical_drop \n",
    "\n",
    "I then evaluated the differences between my initial model and random forest model and came to the conclusion that the random forest model has a lower cross-validation mean absolute error by almost $1. It also exhibits less variability. Verifying performance on the test set produces performance consistent with the cross-validation results."
